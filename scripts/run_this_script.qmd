## Clean LEQ Data & Save Output Files

## VARIABLES - UPDATE THESE TO RUN SCRIPT

Press the play button on the right-hand-side **after updating the variables** to clean and save the LEQ data in your desired output.

```{r}
#---------------------INPUT DATA
input_var <- "data/2023-03-16_leq_data" #change this file path to match where your data is located and the file name WITHOUT the file extension. This is the data exported from the LEQ on Qualtrics as a CSV file.

#---------------------OUTPUT DATA
output_var <- "output/" #change this file path to match where your cleaned data should be saved. This is JUST the folder name, the file name will be created in the script.

#---------------------DATA TYPE FOR OUTPUT
data_type <- c("long") #what type of data output do you want? Options are: "long", which will output a dataset with one row per ID per language per situation; "wide_summary" which will output a dataset with one row per ID and only the overall language estimates (overall, cumulative, global, current for the final situation only) and no detail for each situation; "wide_detailed" which will output a dataset with one row per ID and all information for each language and each situation in its own column. You can export multiple types by using the c() function, for example: c("long", "wide_summary")
